# How to Contribute to RxRecyclerView

1. Fork\!
2. Pull Request\!
3. Code Review / Changes\!
4. Profit\!

That's basically all there is to it.  If Contributing becomes a regular thing, I'll add a checkstyle.
Basically, here's some things to watch out for:

1. Do not use mX variable naming
2. Do stick to Java best practices
3. Do stick a space between operators, braces, etc.
4. Keep it small\! That means no Guava...

Things I'd like see contributed are:

1. Simple scenario Adapter classes
2. More Activities and Espresso tests for them

As always, any contributions are awesome, and I'm interested in hearing feedback from users.
