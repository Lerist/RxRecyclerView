/**
 * Immutable Event for adapter change.
 *
 * If you would like to extend this object, the recommended way is to define a subclass with TYPE UNKNOWN.  You can then
 * filter the incoming observable within your adapter for this subclass.  Since you are required to define your types
 * when you declare your adapter, K and V will be known, so a non-parameterized Subclass is an option here.  If you
 * really need parameterized subclasses otherwise, my recommendation is to do something along the same lines as I did
 * here with Type, OR figure out the proper generics typing for the RX Java Methods to like your subscribers.
 *
 * You can listen to a custom subclass in your adapter constructor with observer.ofType(), or you can create a Filter
 * as I have done in this class an event's subtype against a type passed by constructor. (See RxRecyclerView.java for
 * an example, and RxAdapterEvent.TypeFilter for an example)
 *
 * @param <K> The Key for this object (such as an ID number)
 * @param <V> The Value for this object (The object itself)
